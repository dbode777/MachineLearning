# Machine Learning

This repository shows a few examples of machine learning models, along with some discussion on each model's strengths, weaknesses, and ideal use situations. Some of these examples include plots of the predicted values to actual values, residual plots, and several other statistical calculations to check the model's accuracy and performance. Models explored include: Linear Regression with SciKit Learn's LinearRegression class, Linear Regression with SciKit Learn's Lasso CV class, Logistic Regression, K-Means clustering and several more!
